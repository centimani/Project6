Project 6 is a testing projecting using the jasmine API. We're testing a RSS Feed using differnt parameters to test to see if the feed is initialized, poplulated, and generally functioning. We were given some explict tests to make sure they were working. These include:
  The allFeeds variable to be defined.
  That allFeeds URL values are not empty.
  The allFeeds Title is not empty.
  The Menu is hidden by default.
  The Menu opens and closes when it is clicked.
  loadFeed, an async function is called, completed, and has at least one entry
  and that content changes when it is finished loading. 
  
The testing file is at Project6/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js, and to test just open index.html
